# AutoScriptX - AI-Driven Automated Script Writing Assistant

AutoScriptX is an AI-powered tool designed to assist scriptwriters, filmmakers, and content creators in generating and refining scripts. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, this tool aims to streamline the scriptwriting process, offering creative suggestions, format corrections, and even narrative feedback.

## Key Features

- **Idea Generation**: Users can input basic plot points, and AutoScriptX generates a script outline, suggesting possible story arcs and character developments.
- **Dialogue Enhancement**: Improve existing dialogue with suggestions for more natural or genre-specific language.
- **Format Standardization**: Automatically formats scripts to industry standards, including scene headings, action descriptions, character dialogues, and parentheticals.
- **Narrative Feedback**: Analyzes the script for narrative consistency, pacing, and character development, providing actionable feedback.
- **Collaborative Writing**: Facilitates collaborative writing features, allowing multiple users to work on the same script with real-time updates and version control.

## Technologies

- Advanced NLP techniques for text generation and understanding (e.g., GPT-3 or newer versions from OpenAI).
- Machine learning algorithms for style and tone analysis (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
- Web development frameworks for the user interface (e.g., React, Angular).
